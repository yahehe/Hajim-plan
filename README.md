# Hajim School 4 Year Schedule Application

## Overview

Based on the Angular JS tutorial. An app for incoming freshman to use when trying to plan out long term schedules, while staying in line with the strict Hajim school degree requirements, and stayin on track to graduate.

## Prerequisites

### Git

- A good place to learn about setting up git is [here][git-github]
- Git [home][git-home] (download, documentation)

### Node.js

- Get [Node.js][node-download].

## Workings of the application

- The application filesystem layout structure is based on the [angular-seed] project.
- There is no dynamic backend (no application server) for this application. Instead we fake the
  an application server by fetching static json files.
- Read the Development section at the end to familiarize yourself with running and developing
  an angular application.

## Development with angular-seed

The following docs describe how you can test and develop further this application.

### Running the app during development

1. Run `npm start`
2. navigate your browser to `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html` to see the app running in your browser.

### Running unit tests

We recommend using [Jasmine][jasmine] and [Karma][karma] for your unit tests/specs, but you are free
to use whatever works for you.

- Ensure the tools are installed: run `npm install`.
- Start Karma with `npm test`
  - A browser will start and connect to the Karma server. Chrome is the default browser, others can
  be captured by loading the same url as the one in Chrome or by changing the `test/karma.conf.js`
  file.
- Karma will sit and watch your application and test JavaScript files. To run or re-run tests just
  change any of your these files.


### End to end testing

We recommend using [Jasmine][jasmine] and [Protractor][protractor] for end-to-end testing.

Requires a webserver that serves the application. See Running the app during development, above.

- Ensure that the tools are installed: run `npm install`.
- Serve the application: run `npm start`.
- In a separate console run the end2end tests: `npm run protractor`. Protractor will execute the
  end2end test scripts against the web application itself.
  - The configuration is set up to run the tests on Chrome directly. If you want to run against
    other browsers then you must install the webDriver, `npm run update-webdriver`, and modify the
    configuration at `test/protractor-conf.js`.
